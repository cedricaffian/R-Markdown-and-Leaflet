## Introduction
We create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet 
and host our webpage on either GitHub Pages.

Our webpage must contain the date that we created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet.

### The code of the map

```{r}


library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>%
        addMarkers(lat=-34.6922349, lng=-58.328331, 
             popup="My favorite park")
my_map




```
